This project uses Spring Boot with a layered architecture: controller, service, and repository. Hibernate handled ORM with JPA annotations to map Java objects to a relational database. It exposes RESTful endpoints to create, read, and delete employees. On the frontend, I built a simple HTML/JavaScript interface that fetches data from the API and allows user interaction. I also wrote JUnit and Mockito tests for the repository and service layers to ensure logic and data integrity
